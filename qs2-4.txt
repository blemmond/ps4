Q 2:
None of the columns in this dataset contain multiple values, so the data is already in 1NF. However, I would like to separate the data into 'Collection Information' and 'Location Information' (coll_info and location).
These tables would both use Collection_Number as the primary key, since this field is not null and only contains unique values. 
coll_info would contain: Collection_Number, Start_date, Genus, Species, Host, Voucher_Specimen
location would contain: Collection_Number, Unit_Code, Foray_Name, Protocol_Name, Outside_Plot

Qs 3&4:

import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import sqlite3

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///collections.db', echo=True)
conn = engine.connect()

data=pd.read_csv('pcrn_fungi_inventory_ALL.csv')

data.to_sql('collections',con=engine, if_exists='replace', index='false')

conn.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS coll_info;")
conn.execute("CREATE TABLE coll_info (Collection_Number integer primary key, Start_date, Genus, Species, Host, Voucher_Specimen);")
conn.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS location;")
conn.execute("CREATE TABLE location (Collection_Number integer primary key, Unit_Code, Foray_Name, Protocol_Name, Outside_Plot);")
